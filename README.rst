A collection of helper scripts for ICAT
=======================================

This repository intends to provide an unsorted collection of helper
scripts that may be useful in the administration of an `ICAT`_
service.


System requirements
-------------------

The scripts are independent of each other and may each have their
individual list of requirements.  However, most scripts will be
implemented in Python and use python-icat.  Thus:

Python:

+ Python 3.4 or newer.

Required library packages:

+ `python-icat`_
